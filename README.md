# imba-server-boilerplate

Boilerplate for server-side projects written in Imba.
After you clone the project run ```yarn``` to install dependencies.

You can use the following scripts:
```yarn dev``` to watch for file changes and rerun the application.
```yarn release``` to build application for production into the 'release' folder
```yarn run``` to run application once from the 'source' directory
